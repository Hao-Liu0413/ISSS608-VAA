Overview\n\nThis first take-home exercise aims to provide a detailed visualization of Singapore's demographic structure in 2024. Three visual representations will be described in this project:\n\n-   **An enhanced population pyramid** that reveals age-sex bulges, gaps, and the median age.\n\n-   **A bar-chart comparison** showing which planning areas are most youth- and elder-skewed.\n\n-   **A bubble scatter** mapping youth vs. elderly shares, with bubble size for population and color for median age.\n\nBefore we dive into those, here is a choropleth map of population density across Singapore’s 55 planning areas, ligheter tan tones indicate low density, while progressively darker reds mark higher density band.\n\n![](The-subzone-residential-population-density-map-of-Singapore-PD-stands-for-population.png)\n\n::: callout-note\nSource: Spatial super-spreaders and super-susceptibles in human movement networks - Scientific Figure on ResearchGate.

Data structure\n\nThe *Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024* dataset, shared by [Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/), is composed by 5 main columns:\n\n| Column | Type | Description | Example |\n|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------|\n| Planning Area | Text | One of the 55 official planning areas designated by URA. | Central Area |\n| Subzone | Text | A finer subdivision within each planning area (e.g. neighbourhood or precinct name). | Chinatown |\n| Age | Text | Single-year age categories plus special labels for youngest (“Under 1”) and oldest (“65 and over”, “90 and over”). | Under 1; 27; 65 and over |\n| Sex | Text | Resident gender—exactly two values: “Male” or “Female”. | Female |\n| 2024 | Text→Numeric | Resident count for June 2024. Imported as text (formatting) then cast to numeric for analysis. | “10356” → 10356 |\n\n## 2. Data cleaning\n\n### 2.1 Load the necessary packages\n\n| Package | Description |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| matrixStats | Provides optimized, vectorized functions for row‐ and column‐wise summaries on matrices. |\n| readxl | Used to import Excel files (.xls and .xlsx) into R data frames without requiring Java or external dependencies. |\n| dplyr | A grammar of data manipulation. |\n| stringr | A consistent wrapper around R’s string‐processing functions, built on the {stringi} engine. |\n| readr | Provides functions for reading flat files (CSV, TSV, FWf). |\n| ggplot2 | Implements the “Grammar of Graphics” for creating complex, multi‐layered visualizations. |\n| ggrepel | An add‐on to ggplot2 that smartly repels text and label annotations so they do not overlap. |\n| scales | Provides a suite of functions for transforming and formatting axis breaks, labels, and legends. |\n| patchwork | Used for assembling multiple ggplot2 plots into complex layouts without resorting to low‐level grid hacks. |\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(matrixStats)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### 2.2 Data selection and transformation\n\nThe data is loaded into environment by eliminating those rows with values \"Total\" for the reason that it could construct a distortion of data analysis at individual-area or individual-age level. The imported data (column: 'Population') has been converted into numeric format that ensures the following algebraic calculation (sum, average, or counts).\n\nMany values of column 'Age' has been transformed:\n\n1\\. “Under x” entries (e.g. “Under 1”) become age 0.\n\n2\\. “Over x” or “x and over” (e.g. “65 and over”) are parsed to the base number (65).\n\nAny rows where the population or parsed age turned into NA are removed. This guards against stray text labels or malformed entries that slipped past the earlier filters.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 1.

Aggregate df_clean by Age_numeric and Sex to sum total residents.\n\n2.  Sign-flip males negative & females positive (PopSigned) so bars extend left/right.\n\n3.  Compute Extremes\n\n-   Weighted median age (matrixStats::weightedMedian).\n\n-   Top 3 bulge cohorts (slice_max()) and all tiny cohorts (\\<1% share).\n\n4.  Plot with ggplot2:\n\n-   geom_col() for the back-to-back bars.\n\n-   geom_vline() + annotate() for median age.\n\n-   geom_segment() + geom_text() arrows for bulges; geom_point() + labels for gaps.\n\n-   coord_flip(), absolute y-axis labels, and a clean theme.\n\n### 3.2 Comparing Youth vs. Elderly Shares\n\n**Research Questions:**\n\n-   Which planning areas have the highest share of residents under age 15?\n\n-   Which planning areas have the highest share of residents aged 65+?\n\n**Analytical Approach:**\n\n-   Compute Shares for each Planning Area.\n\n-   Select Top 10 of each metric via slice_max(n=10).\n\n-   Plot horizontally with geom_col(), green bars for under-15, red bars for 65+; format axes with scales::percent_format().\n\n-   Compose side-by-side using patchwork::p_young + p_old.\n\n### 3.3 Spatial Patterns: Median Age & Population Density\n\n**Research Questions:**\n\n-   How do youth and elderly shares co-vary across all 55 planning areas?\n\n-   Are “youth hubs” (high under-15 & high density) distinct from “retirement clusters” (high 65+ & low density)?\n\n-   What role does median age play in these groupings?\n\n**Analytical Approach:**\n\n1.  Compute Metrics for each Planning Area:\n\n-   youth_share, elderly_share as above\n\n-   total_pop = sum(Population)\n\n-   median_age = weightedMedian(Age_numeric, Population)\n\n2.  Global Benchmarks: calculate means and Pearson r.\n\n3.  Plot with ggplot2:\n\n-   aes(x = youth_share, y = elderly_share, size = total_pop, color = median_age)\n\n-   geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", linetype=\"dotted\")\n\n-   geom_vline()/geom_hline() at mean shares\n\n-   ggrepel::geom_text_repel() to label areas\n\n-   Color scale (viridis_c()), percent axes, and a minimal theme.\n\n### 3.4 Visualization Deliverables\n\n| deliverable | Research Question(s) | Plot Type | Key Features |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| **1.

Which cohorts are bulges (\\<1%) or gaps? | Back-to-back bar chart (`geom_col`) | Males left/females right; weighted median line; arrows + labels for top 3 cohorts; points for \\<1 % ages |\n| **2.

Which have the highest share 65 +? | Horizontal bar charts (`geom_col`) | Green bars for under 15; red bars for 65 +; top 10 lists; percent-formatted x-axis; patchwork layout |\n| **3. Youth-Elderly Bubble Scatter** | 3.3 How do youth and elderly shares co-vary across all planning areas?

The overall median age is 42 and top 3 largest cohorts are age 33,35, and 36, while small blue dots identifies cohorts under 1% of their sex's total.\n\nSex differences are also evident: although both sides mirror each other through most working-age groups, the female bars extend further at ages 70+, illustrating higher female longevity. Male and female distributions converge between ages 20–40, indicating balanced labor-force cohorts. he chart underscores Singapore’s transition to an older population, highlights cohort‐specific “bulges” at 35 and 55, and flags a shrinking base of young children.\n:::\n\n### 4.2 Visualization 2 (Age Distributions by Planning Area)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 1.

These are newer or rapidly developing districts—Punggol’s waterfront estates, Changi’s airport-linked communities—where young families cluster. Southern Islands and Western Water Catchment also show surprisingly high youth shares, reflecting small but family-oriented populations in those zones. In contrast, Outram leads the “oldest” list at nearly 29 % aged 65 +, closely followed by Ang Mo Kio and Bukit Merah. These mature, inner-city precincts—home to long-established HDB estates and retirement facilities—have proportionally more seniors. Areas like Bedok, Queenstown, and Toa Payoh likewise appear, underscoring how Singapore’s first-generation housing towns still house an aging cohort.\n\nTaken together, these charts pinpoint where childhood services (schools, playgrounds) might be most needed—Punggol, Changi, Tengah—and where eldercare resources (community centers, healthcare) should be prioritized—Outram, Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah.\n:::\n\n### 4.3 Visualization 3 (Spatial Patterns: Median Age & Population Density)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 1.
