Data cleaning\n\n2.1 Load the necessary packages\nBefore starting the analysis, we install and load a set of R packages that help our data‐wrangling, text-parsing, and visualization toolkit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmatrixStats\nProvides optimized, vectorized functions for row‐ and column‐wise summaries on matrices.\n\n\nreadxl\nUsed to import Excel files (.xls and .xlsx) into R data frames without requiring Java or external dependencies.\n\n\ndplyr\nA grammar of data manipulation.\n\n\nstringr\nA consistent wrapper around R’s string‐processing functions, built on the {stringi} engine.\n\n\nreadr\nProvides functions for reading flat files (CSV, TSV, FWf).\n\n\nggplot2\nImplements the “Grammar of Graphics” for creating complex, multi‐layered visualizations.\n\n\nggrepel\nAn add‐on to ggplot2 that smartly repels text and label annotations so they do not overlap.\n\n\nscales\nProvides a suite of functions for transforming and formatting axis breaks, labels, and legends.\n\n\npatchwork\nUsed for assembling multiple ggplot2 plots into complex layouts without resorting to low‐level grid hacks.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(matrixStats)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\n\n2.2 Data cleaning\nThe data is loaded into environment by eliminating those rows with values “Total” for the reason that it could construct a distortion of data analysis at individual-area or individual-age level. The imported data (column: ‘Population’) has been converted into numeric format that ensures the future algebraic calculation (sum, average, or counts).\nMany values of column ‘Age’ has been transformed:\n\n“Under x” entries (e.g. “Under 1”) become age 0.\n“Over x” or “x and over” (e.g. “65 and over”) are parsed to the base number (65).\n\nAny rows where the population or parsed age turned into null values are removed. This guards against stray text labels or malformed entries that slipped past the earlier filters.\n\n# 1. Read in data and drop all “Total” summary rows\ndf_clean &lt;- read_excel(\"respopagesex2024e.xlsx\") %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    `Planning Area` != \"Total\",\n    Subzone         != \"Total\",\n    Sex             != \"Total\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  # 2.

It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\nA Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\nCombining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\nThe plotThe codePractice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p3 # other plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe codePractice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p3) | p2 # different composition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\nCreating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe codePractice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = '1') # different tag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\nThe plotThe codePractice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\np2 + inset_element(p3, \n                   left = 0.5, \n                   bottom = 1, \n                   right = 0.02, \n                   top = 0.7) # different position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nThe plotThe codePractice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p2 / p1) | p3\npatchwork & theme_dark()"

By using ‘mutate’ function, we are going to transform raw counts into per-sex percentages, then turns the result into signed and absolute forms for plotting and annotation.\n\n# 1.

The median age is 42 and top 3 largest age groups are around 33,35, and 36.\nSex differences are also evident: although there is not huge differences between them, the female bars extend further at ages 70+, indicating a higher female longevity. Both gender distributions converge between ages 20–40, that confirms a balanced labor-force cohorts. The chart inspires Singapore’s transition to an older population (as happen in Japan), with age groups “bulges” at 35 and 55, and flags a shrinking base of young children.\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Visualization 2 (Age Distributions by Planning Area)\nAs mentioned in the analytical approch (3.2 Comparing Youth vs. Elderly Shares), in this phase, we compute the ‘youth_share’ and ‘elederly_share’ by using these formulas:\nyouth_share = sum(Population[Age_numeric &lt; 15]) / sum(Population)\nelderly_share = sum(Population[Age_numeric &gt;= 65]) / sum(Population)\n\n# 1.

Southern Islands and Western Water Catchment show high youth shares as well, indicating small but family-oriented populations in those zones. The second plot identifies Outram as the “oldest” district at nearly 29 % of 65 + age group, followed by Ang Mo Kio and Bukit Merah. These mature, inner-city precincts have proportionally more seniors. Areas like Bedok, Queenstown, and Toa Payoh likewise appear, underscoring how Singapore’s first-generation housing towns still house an aging cohort.\nThe plot contributes to where childhood services (schools, playgrounds) might be most needed (Punggol, Changi, Tengah) and where eldercare resources (community centers, healthcare) should be prioritized (Outram, Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah).\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Visualization 3 (Spatial Patterns: Median Age & Population Density)\nAs done in the previous plot, we have to compute the key metrics for our visualization task by using these formulas:\nyouth_share = sum(Population[Age_numeric &lt; 15]) / sum(Population)\nelderly_share = sum(Population[Age_numeric &gt;= 65]) / sum(Population)\ntotal_pop = sum(Population)\nmedian_age = matrixStats::weightedMedian(Age_numeric, w = Population)\n\n# 1.

On the y-axis (‘Share of residents 65 and over’), Outram, Rochor, and Ang Mo Kio sit near 25–30 % aged 65 +, marking them as “retirement clusters.” The vertical and horizontal dashed lines show national average shares (~13 % youth, ~17 % elderly), and the dotted regression line (r ≈ –0.07) confirms almost no linear trade-off between youth and senior population, means that changes in youth shares do not reliably predict changes in elderly shares.\nPunggol’s large dot highlights its sizable young population, while Outram has a small portion of residents but the highest percentage of “retirement clusters”. This visualization indicates true “youth hubs” and “elder hubs” at a glance, enriched by population and age-structure context.\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Conclusion\nThe pyramid plot shows that Singapore’s population reveals a clear shift toward an older population, and a higher longevity of female resident compared to male groups. By examining the planning ares data, Changi and Punggol are unmistakable “youth hubs” (as confirmed in visualization 2,3), whereas Outram, Ang Mo Kio and Bugit Merah stand out as “retirement clusters”.\nAn interesting part is shown in the visualization 3, which confirms that extreme concentrations of children and seniors seldom overlap and most districts clustering near the national average. Likewise, the correlation indicator (r = -0.07) indicates there is no significant correlation between two groups, changes in youth shares will not affect elderly population. Most of area are in the middle position rather than being an outlier of the data."

    "text": "5.3 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n5.4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Finishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\nClaus O.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n6.3.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.
